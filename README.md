I am a software developer with a passion for creating user-friendly and efficient
applications. I have experience in MERN Stack(MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

I have been an avid player of League of Legends for over a decade, and saw the creation of
this project as an opportunity to utilize my skills as a software developer to benefit
myself and my fellow players. The goal of this project is to provide a valuable resource
for gathering and analyzing data that can be used to improve gameplay strategies and
decision making. It is my hope that this project will serve as a long-term tool for myself
and the League of Legends community.

Feel free to reach out to me via my [website](https://tyestanley.herokuapp.com/) or
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tye-stanley/) if you have any questions or
suggestions! I am always looking to improve and expand upon my work.
